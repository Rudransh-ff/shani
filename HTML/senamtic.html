            <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
            <p>
                Dogs have a sense of time but don't understand the 'concept' of time. Unlike humans,dogs don't have the ability 
                to create actual measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don't know how to read clocks.
                So, telling them 'I ll be back in 15 minutes'won't really do much, but we understand that you feel like you
                have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on past events based on pastexperiences.
                Pavlov's dogs are the perfect example of this.
